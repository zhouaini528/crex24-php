### It is recommended that you read the official document first

Crex24 docs [https://docs.crex24.com/trade-api/v2/](https://docs.crex24.com/trade-api/v2/)

All interface methods are initialized the same as those provided by huobi. See details [src/api](https://github.com/zhouaini528/crex24-php/tree/master/src/Api)

Most of the interface is now complete, and the user can continue to extend it based on my design, working with me to improve it.
